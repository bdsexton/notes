# Notes

**Development and system configuration notes. Maybe other notes too. We'll see.**

## Overview

I take a lot of notes using both paper and various applications. Software development procedures and options, system and application configuration options, lists of useful tools, services, and commandsâ€”stuff like that.

Many of my notes would be more useful to me and may also be useful to others if they were readily accessible (e.g., when setting up a new employer or client system), so I want to start posting some of my notes publicly via [GitHub](https://github.com/).

## More Info

I also have several potentially useful things posted on [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/bdsexton).

You may also find some useful information and code in [my personal repositories](https://github.com/bdsexton?tab=repositories) or [Carroket's repositories](https://github.com/carroket).

## Whose notes are these?

These notes are by [Brian Sexton](http://briansexton.com/) of [Carroket, Inc.](http://carroket.com/)
